## Description
This is an embedded systems project which was assigned to me during the course of studying Udacity's Embedded Systems Professional Nanodegree.

It is basically a traffic light control system with 3 LEDs for traffic, 3 LEDs for pedestrians and an integrated push button for the pedestrians when they need to cross the street.

This project was done using ATmega32 microcontroller.

## Used Peripherals
- GPIO
- Interrupts
- Timers
